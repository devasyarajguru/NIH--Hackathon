            Women's health in India faces various challenges, including high maternal mortality rates, limited access to healthcare in rural areas, gender-based discrimination, and cultural taboos surrounding reproductive health. Malnutrition and anemia are prevalent issues among women, impacting their overall well-being. Increasing awareness, improving healthcare infrastructure, and promoting gender equality are crucial for addressing these concerns.
